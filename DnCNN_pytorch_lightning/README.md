# DnCNN-PT-Lightning

- Simple PyTorch Lightning implementation of DnCNN (Denoising Convolution Neural Network).

- The notebook has been adapted from this awesome [repository](https://github.com/lychengr3x/Image-Denoising-with-Deep-CNNs) by [lychengr3x](https://github.com/lychengr3x).

- Relatively large codebase shrunk down to a single notebook.


Implements a residual learning approach to denoise an image based on the BSDS-100 Dataset. Can be directly used in Colab.
